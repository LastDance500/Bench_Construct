<h2 id="get-started">üöÄ Getting Started</h2>


1. Requirements

<pre><code>
pip install -r requirements.txt
</code></pre>

2. Check the source data.
    
    We provide one data example (Health & Medicine) in ./data folder. For the all ontologies are too large for github repo,
    we put them in the drive for everyone to download: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1jpvdZ9uH9ZOXhrDiJdFI9wjvJM1DGwmj?usp=sharing

3. Place the data
    if you download the source data, put them into the ./data folder.

4. Run the scripts in Processing

    <pre><code>
    cd Processing
    cd understanding # to the target level
    cd 1_1_class2definition # to the target task
    python3 task_generate.py
    </code></pre>

5. Bench creation
   
    After you finish the generation, some json files will automatically save to 
     ./bench folder.
    
    <pre><code>
    cd ..
    cd bench/bench_1_1 # to the target task
    find . -type f -name "post-processing.py" -exec bash -c 'cd "$(dirname "{}")" && python post-processing.py' \;
    python3 combine.py
   </code></pre>
